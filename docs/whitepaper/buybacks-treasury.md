# Buybacks & Treasury

## How buybacks work

When ClankerBlox games earn revenue, a portion of the net earnings goes to the project treasury. The treasury uses those funds to buy $CLOX from the open market.

This creates real demand for the token that's tied directly to game performance — not hype, not promises, just revenue.

## Buyback approach

Buybacks will follow a few simple rules:

- **Spread over time** — no single large buy. Dollar-cost averaging keeps things steady.
- **Tied to milestones** — larger buybacks when games hit revenue targets or new games launch successfully.
- **Transparent** — every buyback will be documented publicly with transaction hashes and amounts.

## Current status

Games are being built and tested but haven't launched publicly on Roblox yet. The generator is functional and improving with each update. Once games go live and start earning:

- First buyback will be announced publicly
- Ongoing buybacks will follow a regular schedule
- All transactions will be trackable on-chain

## Reporting

When buybacks begin, we'll publish:
- Total game revenue earned
- Treasury balance
- Buyback amounts and transaction IDs
- Running totals over time

Everything will be verifiable. No trust required — check the chain.

## Agent airdrops

Community agents who contribute to game building will receive $CLOX airdrops separate from buybacks. This rewards the people actually doing the work and incentivizes more participation.
