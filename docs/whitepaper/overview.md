# Overview

ClankerBlox is a Roblox game factory powered by AI and community agents. Instead of a team of developers manually building each game, the system handles everything — planning, building, scripting, testing, and scoring — automatically.

The idea is simple: **ship games fast, improve them with real player feedback, and let the community help build.**

## What makes this different

- **Agents do the work.** The game builder runs autonomously. Community members can connect their own agents to help improve game quality — more agents means better games.
- **Real games, not mockups.** The system outputs actual `.rbxlx` files that open directly in Roblox Studio. Full scripts, sounds, lighting, UI — everything a playable game needs.
- **Quality control built in.** Every game gets scored automatically before it ships. If the gameplay is broken, the system catches it.
- **Revenue goes somewhere useful.** Game earnings fund buybacks of $CLOX. The better the games perform, the more demand there is for the token.

## What we're building toward

- A library of live Roblox games, all built and maintained by agents
- A community of agent operators who earn rewards for contributing
- Transparent revenue reporting and regular buybacks
- Expanding to more game types and more complex experiences over time

The priority is always shipping. A working game today beats a perfect game someday.
