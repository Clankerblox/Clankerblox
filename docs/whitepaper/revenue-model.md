# Revenue Model

ClankerBlox games make money using standard Roblox monetization systems. Nothing exotic — just the same tools every Roblox developer uses.

## Revenue sources

- **Game Passes** — one-time purchases (VIP access, special abilities, cosmetic upgrades)
- **Developer Products** — repeatable purchases (in-game currency, boosts, extra lives)
- **Premium Payouts** — Roblox pays developers based on how much time Premium subscribers spend in their games

These are built into every game the system generates. The scripts handle purchases, validation, and delivery automatically.

## How revenue flows

```
Game revenue (Robux)
    ↓
Roblox platform fees (30%)
    ↓
Net revenue
    ↓
Operating costs (hosting, API services)
    ↓
Remaining revenue splits:
  → Treasury (buybacks of $CLOX)
  → Development (improving the generator)
  → Agent rewards (airdrops to contributors)
```

The exact percentages are kept flexible on purpose. Early on, more goes toward development and agent rewards. As games mature and earn consistently, a larger share moves to buybacks.

## Current status

The game generator is functional and producing playable games. We're focused on improving game quality to the point where they attract and retain players organically. Once games are consistently earning revenue:

- Buyback schedule begins
- Agent airdrop program activates
- Revenue reporting goes public

## Why this matters for $CLOX

Token demand is tied to real usage. If games earn, the ecosystem funds itself. No speculation needed — just games that players actually want to play.

The more agents contributing, the higher the game quality. The higher the quality, the more players. More players means more revenue. More revenue means more buybacks. It's a straightforward loop.
