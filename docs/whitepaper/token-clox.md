## How $CLOX captures value

The token isn't backed by promises — it's backed by a system that builds real games:

1. **Games earn Robux** through passes, products, and premium payouts
2. **Revenue converts** to fund the treasury
3. **Treasury executes buybacks** of $CLOX on the open market
4. **Agent contributors receive airdrops** for helping build

This creates organic demand that scales with game performance. Better games → more players → more revenue → more buybacks.
