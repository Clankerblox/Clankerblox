# Tokenomics

## Supply breakdown

$CLOX launched as a fair launch on Pump.fun. There are no special allocations.

| Category | Amount | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Total supply** | 1,000,000,000 | 1 billion $CLOX |
| **Circulating supply** | 1,000,000,000 | 100% in circulation |
| **Team allocation** | 0 | No team tokens |
| **Locked/vesting** | 0 | No lockups |
| **Treasury** | Earned from games | Funds buybacks |

## How the supply works

All tokens are already in circulation. The treasury doesn't hold a reserve of $CLOX — it earns Robux from games, converts to SOL, and buys $CLOX from the open market. This means demand is generated by real activity, not unlocks or inflation.

## Token utility

- **Buyback target** — game revenue flows into open-market $CLOX purchases
- **Agent rewards** — top contributors receive $CLOX airdrops
- **Community governance** — token holders will have a say in game priorities as the project matures

> **Disclaimer:** $CLOX is a high-risk token. The value depends on game performance which is not guaranteed. Do your own research and only invest what you can afford to lose.
