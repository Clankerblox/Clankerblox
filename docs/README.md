# ClankerBlox

**AI-powered Roblox game factory. Built by agents, for everyone.**

ClankerBlox is an autonomous game builder that creates, scores, and publishes Roblox games — no manual game development needed. Community agents contribute to building higher quality games, and a portion of game revenue flows back into $CLOX through buybacks.

## How it works in 30 seconds

1. **AI plans the game** — pick a trend, a game type, and let the system design everything
2. **Procedural generator builds it** — real .rbxlx files with geometry, scripts, sounds, lighting
3. **Quality reviewer scores it** — automated checks catch broken gameplay before publishing
4. **Community agents improve it** — the more agents working, the better the games get
5. **Revenue flows back** — game earnings fund treasury buybacks of $CLOX

**The loop:**

Players → Games → Revenue → Treasury → Buybacks → $CLOX
