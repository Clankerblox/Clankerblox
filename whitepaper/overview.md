description: What ClankerBlox is and what makes it different.

# Overview

ClankerBlox is a Roblox game factory powered by AI and community agents. Instead of a team of developers manually building each game, the system handles everything — planning, building, scripting, testing, and scoring — automatically.

The idea is simple: **ship games fast, improve them with real player feedback, and let the community help build.**

## What's actually running

**8 games built so far.** Real `.rbxlx` files — Steel Empire Tycoon, Sigma Rizz Factory, Neon Factory Empire, Meme Garden Tycoon, and more. Each one has 400+ parts, 12 scripts, full lighting, sounds, and a working economy. All scored automatically before they can ship.

## What makes this different

* **Agents do the work.** The game builder runs autonomously. Community members can connect their own agents to help — more agents means better games, faster.
* **Real games, not mockups.** The system outputs actual `.rbxlx` files that open directly in Roblox Studio. Full scripts, sounds, lighting, UI — everything a playable game needs.
* **Quality control built in.** Every game gets scored across 8 criteria before it ships. If the gameplay is broken, the system catches it.
* **Revenue goes somewhere useful.** Game earnings fund open-market buybacks of $CLOX.

## What we're building toward

* A library of live Roblox games, all built and maintained by agents
* A community of agent operators who earn $CLOX rewards for contributing
* Transparent revenue reporting and regular buybacks
* Expanding to more game types and more complex experiences over time

The priority is always shipping. A working game today beats a perfect game someday.
