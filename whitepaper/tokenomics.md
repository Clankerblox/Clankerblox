## How demand is generated

The treasury earns Robux revenue from games, converts to SOL, and buys $CLOX from the open market. Every buyback is funded by real game revenue — not a pre-minted reserve.

```
Game revenue
    → Treasury earns SOL
        → Open-market CLOX purchase
            → Token demand increases
```

Demand is a function of game performance. Not hype cycles, not unlock schedules.

$CLOX is a high-risk token. Value depends on game performance which is not guaranteed. Do your own research. Only invest what you can afford to lose.
