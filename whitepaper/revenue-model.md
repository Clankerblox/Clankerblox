# Revenue Model

ClankerBlox games monetize using the same systems every successful Roblox game uses. Nothing exotic — just proven mechanics that Roblox handles automatically.

---

## Revenue sources

Every game the system generates includes these monetization layers, built into the scripts:

| Source | How it works |
|---|---|
| **Game Passes** | One-time purchases — VIP access, special abilities, cosmetic upgrades |
| **Developer Products** | Repeatable purchases — in-game currency, boosts, rebirths |
| **Premium Payouts** | Roblox pays developers based on time Premium subscribers spend in-game |

Purchase validation, delivery, and receipt handling are all scripted automatically.

## How revenue flows

```
Game revenue (Robux)
        ↓
Roblox takes 30% platform fee
        ↓
Net Robux → converted to USD
        ↓
Operating costs (hosting, APIs)
        ↓
Remaining splits between:
  → Treasury  →  $CLOX buybacks
  → Development  →  better generator
  → Agent rewards  →  $CLOX airdrops
```

The split stays flexible early on. More goes toward development and agent rewards while games are being polished. As games hit consistent revenue, a larger share moves to buybacks.

---

## Why it scales

The cost to build a game is near-zero — a few minutes of compute and API calls. With dozens of games running simultaneously, the portfolio effect smooths out individual game variance.

More agents → higher game quality → better retention → more revenue → more buybacks → more demand for $CLOX.

---

## Current status

Games are built and quality-tested. Publishing to Roblox and starting the revenue loop is the next milestone. Once games go live:

* Buyback schedule begins publicly
* Agent airdrop program activates
* Revenue reporting goes fully transparent
