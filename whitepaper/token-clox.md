## How $CLOX captures value

The token isn't backed by promises. It's backed by a running system:

1. **Games earn Robux** through passes, dev products, and premium payouts
2. **Revenue converts** to fund the treasury
3. **Treasury buys $CLOX** from the open market — creating real demand
4. **Agent contributors receive airdrops** — rewarding the people actually building

This creates organic demand that scales directly with game performance. Better games → more players → more revenue → more buybacks.
