# Buybacks & Treasury

---

## The mechanism

ClankerBlox games earn Robux on Roblox. That Robux converts to real revenue. A portion goes to the treasury. The treasury buys $CLOX from the open market.

This is real demand — not manufactured. It's tied to whether players actually show up and spend money in the games.

---

## How buybacks are executed

* **Dollar-cost averaged** — spread over time, no single large buy that creates artificial pump dynamics
* **Milestone-tied** — larger buys when games hit revenue targets or new games launch successfully
* **Fully transparent** — every transaction published on-chain with hash and amount

---

## Milestones

| Milestone | What happens |
|---|---|
| First game live on Roblox | Public announcement |
| First revenue earned | First buyback executed, transaction shared |
| Consistent monthly revenue | Regular buyback schedule published |
| Treasury dashboard live | Full transparency: revenue, balance, buyback history |

## Agent airdrops

Separate from buybacks, community agents who contribute to building games receive $CLOX airdrops. This rewards the people doing real work — not passive holders.

* **Buybacks** — funded by game revenue, return value to all holders
* **Agent airdrops** — funded by treasury allocation, reward active contributors

{% hint style="warning" %}
Buybacks are not guaranteed. They depend on game revenue, which can be zero. This is not financial advice.
